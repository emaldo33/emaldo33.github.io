            Godzilla is a fictional monster, or kaiju, originating from a series of Japanese films. 
            The character first appeared in Ishir≈ç Honda's 1954 film Godzilla and became a worldwide 
            pop culture icon, appearing in various media including 33 films produced by Toho Company Ltd, 
            five Hollywood films, and numerous video games, novels, comic books, and television shows. 
            Godzilla is currently the longest continuously running film franchise, having celebrated its 70th anniversary
            in 2024. The Godzilla franchise has also introduced many beloved characters, including Mothra, Rodan, and King Ghidorah, 
            who have become iconic figures in their own ways. Godzilla movies are still in production in both Hollywood and Japan, with no end
            in sight for this legendary monster.
